<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![gif](./image-uploader.gif)

Project Description:

Welcome to my Image Uploader Fullstack App! This project showcases my skills in developing a fullstack application using React, .NET Web API, and Firebase for image storage. With this app, users can easily upload and manage their images.

Demo: You can see the live demo of my Image Uploader Fullstack App by visiting this link: [Image Uploader Demo](https://image-uploader-page.netlify.app/)

Experience: During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience and knowledge. I had the opportunity to work with React and improve my understanding of managing React state. I implemented axios to fetch data from the backend API and learned how to utilize Material-UI (Mui) components to create a visually appealing UI. I also implemented skeleton loading to enhance the user experience while images are being loaded. On the backend side, I developed a .NET Web API to handle various operations. Additionally, I integrated Firebase storage with the .NET backend to securely store the uploaded images.

This project served as a great learning experience for me, as it allowed me to strengthen my frontend and backend development skills. By seamlessly integrating different technologies, I successfully built a robust fullstack application that showcases my abilities in creating an efficient and user-friendly image uploader.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [.NET Web API](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/apis)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/O2iGT9yBd6xZBrOcVirx) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/leonardoapd/image-uploader-master.git

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ vite dev
```

For the backend side, you will need .NET 6.0 installed on your computer. You can download it here: [Download .NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0). Once you have .NET 6.0 installed, you can run the backend API by navigating to the ImageUploader.API directory and running the following command:

```bash
# Run the backend API
$ dotnet watch run
```

You will also need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
# Firebase Config
"API_KEY_STORAGE": "your_api_key",
"AUTH_EMAIL": "your_email",
"AUTH_PASSWORD": "your_password",
"BUCKET_NAME": "your_bucket_name"
```
